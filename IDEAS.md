# Caesar Style - Ideas & Future Plans

## Economy Separation: Food vs Hardware ✅ DONE

Implemented! Food and hardware now have separate pipelines:
- **Food:** Farm/Fishing Wharf → Granary → Market → Houses
- **Hardware:** Mine/Clay Pit/Lumber Camp → Workshop/Potter/Carpenter → Warehouse → Bazaar → Houses

## New Service Buildings

- **Bathhouse** (3x3) — walker coverage: hygiene. Classic Roman building, new coverage type for L3+
- **School** (2x2) — walker coverage: education. Another walker coverage for L4+
- **Theater** (3x3) — walker coverage: entertainment. Late-game coverage for villas/palaces
- **Barber** (1x1) — static coverage: hygiene (short range). Cheap alternative to bathhouse (like well vs fountain)
- **Forum** (3x3) — static desirability + boosts tax collection range. Civic centerpiece

## Infrastructure

- **Plaza** (1x1) — road tile with desirability bonus (decorative road variant)

## Wine Production Chain

- **Vineyard** (4x4) — requires fertility, produces grapes
- **Winery** (2x2) — converts grapes → wine
- Wine as a luxury good required for L4/L5 houses

## Economy Tuning (for later)

- Add building maintenance costs (per-tick drain)
- Steeper tax multiplier curve to reward house evolution more
- Tighter production rates to create scarcity
- Labor tension: increase worker requirements to force housing growth spiral
